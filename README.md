# FLASH-AI-Impact-Hackathon-ChatBot
This project is a modern engineering productivity tool that unifies GitHub commit analytics, JIRA issue tracking, and a powerful LLM-based AI chatbot into a single interactive dashboard. It is designed for development teams, QA engineers, and project managers who need real-time insights and natural-language reporting from their workflow systems.

🚀 AI-Powered GitHub & JIRA Insights Dashboard

AI-Powered Engineering Productivity Platform

A modern, intelligent dashboard that unifies GitHub analytics, JIRA issue tracking, and LLM-based natural-language project insights into one seamless interface.
Designed for engineering teams who want clarity, speed, and AI-augmented decision-making in their development workflow.


🧭 1. Overview

Software teams rely on GitHub for source control and JIRA for task management — yet these two critical systems remain disconnected in most organizations.
This results in delays, blind spots, and inefficient communication.

This project solves that gap by providing:

✅ Unified dashboard combining GitHub commits + JIRA issues
✅ AI-powered assistant that understands project context
✅ Interactive visual analytics for team productivity
✅ Auto-correlation between Git commits and JIRA items

With this platform, developers, QA, and project managers gain a single source of truth for realtime project insights.

🧩 2. Key Features
📈 Git Commit Analytics

✅ Rich insights from GitHub data
✅ Date-range filtering
✅ Developer-wise commit visualization (Plotly)
✅ Auto-correlation between Git commits and JIRA items
✅ Helpful for sprint reviews, productivity analysis & reporting

🧩 JIRA Issue Tracker

✅ Developer-wise issue filtering
✅ Categorization: Blocked, In Progress, To Do, High Priority
✅ Provides structured summaries

🤖 AI Chatbot (LLM-Powered)
Uses LLM intelligence to provide natural-language answers like:

“Show commits linked with JIRA-110”
“What issues are blocking Sachin this week?”
“Which developer contributed most between 10–20 October?”

The LLM reads from both:

Git commit logs

JIRA dataset

and responds with precise, contextual insights.
